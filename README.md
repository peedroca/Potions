### Potions API

The Potions API is a REST API to manage information about yours potions, including ingredients, prepare mode, images that help make your potions, and another information that you want.

### Data Persistence

The goal is to use NoSQL database to storage data. This allows us to make a great application without worry about fields on database, because our data is stored in a document bson.

### Technologies

- ASP.NET Core 3.1 (with .NET Core 3.1)
- Mongo Db 4.2.8
